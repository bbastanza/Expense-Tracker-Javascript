## Summary

I made this app to further my knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS.

Building this app I learned more about using forms in HTML to edit the DOM and how to edit HTML tables through javascript.

I learned a lot during this project and it really helped to cement some concepts I was previously working on while adding a few more minor concepts on top.
