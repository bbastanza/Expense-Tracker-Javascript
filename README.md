## Summary

Building this app I learned more about using HTML tables to display things in a clear and organized way. I was able to work with HTML forms in this and get more comfortable with sending data back and forth from JS and HTML.

I learned a lot during this project. Doing this made me more comfortable using vanilla Javascript and really solidified a lot of the learning I had done up to this point. I know that the process of interacting with HTML through Javascript will be very valueable in the future while working on front end aspects of future, more challenging, applications.
